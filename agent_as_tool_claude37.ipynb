    "## Why Use Multiple Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several compelling reasons to design multi-agent systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specialization**: Each agent can excel at specific tasks using targeted tools and prompts\n",
    "2. **Modularity**: Easier to develop, test, and maintain separate components\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: Independent agents can work in parallel\n",
    "4. **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent can handle different aspects of a complex problem\n",
    "5. **Resilience**: If one agent fails, others can continue operating\n",
